- There are a LOT of books. And we only have limited ressources

- Plenty of solutions!

## Summary

<br> <hr> <br> 

#### We started very small, but we might have learned something new

---
layout: center
---

### Trivial

<br> <hr> <br> 

Let's start with the stuff you likely already knew...

<v-clicks>

- csv (_"duh!"_)
- json (_"Yeah I knew that!"_)
- TypedDict with (Not)Required keys (Maybe new for a few?)
- All of those are in more detail in the /code folder inside the repository

</v-clicks>

<!--
Let's be honest: These are the trivial modules you very likely already 
know
-->

---
layout: center
---

## urllib.requests

<br><hr><br>

<v-clicks>

- fetch and send data via HTTP(S)
- restricted to `GET`/`POST` (POST by setting the `data` parameter)
- not as bad to use as one might think,
  considering the vast amount of modules to replace it
- definetely worth a try, if you only have very few non-async requests

</v-clicks>

<!--
as one might think due to all the alternatives

POST via setting data -> done
Query params via URL ;)
-->

---
layout: center
---

## itertools.islice

<br><hr><br>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- basically works like `mylist[from:to:steps]`
- but also works on Generators with unknown size :)
- cannot go backwards or use negative indizes:
    - works: `mylist[::-1]` (reversing a list)
    - doesn't work: `islice(mygenerator, start=-9, step=-3)`

</v-clicks>

---
layout: center
---

## itertools.batched

<br> <hr> <br>

<v-clicks>

- Finally arrived in `python3.12`
- Works on all kind of iterable stuff
- delivers `tuple[T]` of size `n`
- `list(batched(range(5), 3)) == [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4)]`

</v-clicks>
