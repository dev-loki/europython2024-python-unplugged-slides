Let's move the data on top, as we wanna work with it
TypedDict has numerous advantages over dict 

- typechecks (free automated tests) and better code completion by IDEs 
- this won't be a talk about typing python (ref to typing talk here!)

- There are a LOT of books. And we only have limited ressources
- This means that we need to work on the books in batches
- Plenty of solutions!
- Let's first look on how we might have done it before python3.12
- And then how python3.12 makes our life easier :)

## Summary

<br> <br> 

### We started very small, but which modules did we learn about?

::right::

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

### Trivial

<br> <hr> <br> 

<v-clicks>

- csv (_"duh!"_)
- json (_"Yeah I knew that"_)
- TypedDict (Maybe new)

</v-clicks>

<!--
Let's be honest: These are the trivial modules you very likely already 
know
-->

---
layout: center
---

## urllib.requests

<br><hr><br>

<v-clicks>

- fetch and send data via HTTP(S)
- restricted to `GET`/`POST` (POST by setting the `data` parameter)
- not as bad to use as one might think,
  considering the vast amount of modules to replace it

</v-clicks>

<!--
as one might think due to all the alternatives

POST via setting data -> done
Query params via URL ;)
-->

layout: center

## itertools.islice

<br><hr><br>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- basically works like `mylist[from:to:steps]`
- but also works on Generators with unknown size :)
- cannot go backwards or use negative indizes:
    - works: `mylist[::-1]` (reversing a list)
    - doesn't work: `islice(mygenerator, start=-9, step=-3)`

</v-clicks>

---
layout: center
---

## itertools.batched

<br> <hr> <br>

<v-clicks>

- Finally arrived in `python3.12`
- Works on all kind of iterable stuff
- delivers `tuple[T]` of size `n`
- `list(batched(range(5), 3)) == [(0, 1, 2), (3, 4)]`

</v-clicks>
