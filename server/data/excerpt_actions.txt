baked in dragon fire
breathed fire
cast a spell
chopped with lightning speed
concocted a potion
discovered a secret
drew their sword
fermented mythical ingredients
forged a weapon
haggled over prices
issued a decree
kneaded enchanted dough
made a promise
mined for gems
picked a lock
prepared a feast
raised the dead
read the future
sailed through a storm
sang a melody
seasoned with fairy dust
shot an arrow
solved a riddle
spoke to the winds
stirred a magical broth
tasted for poison
told a joke
tracked a monster
transformed into a beast
