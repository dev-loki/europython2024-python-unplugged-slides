## Duplicate books

<v-clicks depth="2">

- We want to fetch data from the library...
- But as it is a magical library from Ankh Morpork, 
  the books will duplicate!
- The orang utan librarian of the Unseen University wants the list of 
  unique books as CSV (obviously!)
- This is **NOT** a leetcode talk ;)

## Saving the deduplicated data

Basically just an excuse to show grouping of contextmanagers

```python
OUTPUT_FILE = 'library_clean.csv'

def remove_duplicates(iterable: Iterable) -> Iterator: ...


def clean_data(input_csv_file: str) -> str:
    out_name = input_csv_file.replace(".csv", "-clean.csv")

    with (
        Path(input_csv_file).open("r") as read_file,
        Path(out_name).open("w") as write_file,
    ):
        reader = csv.DictReader(read_file)
        writer = csv.DictWriter(write_file)

        for row in remove_duplicates(reader):
            writer.writerow(row)
