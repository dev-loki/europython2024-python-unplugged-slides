## Duplicate books

<hr> 

<v-clicks depth="2">

- We want to fetch data from the library...
- But as it is a magical library from Ankh Morpork, 
  the books will duplicate!
- The orang utan librarian of the Unseen University wants the list of 
  unique books as CSV (obviously!)
- This is **NOT** a leetcode talk ;)

### What new modules did we learn about?

---
layout: center
---

#### pairwise

<hr> 

<v-clicks>

- Signature: `def pairwise(iterable: Iterable[T]) -> Iterable[tuple[T, T]]`
- Makes out of an iterator like `range(10)`...
- ... and iterator like `((0,1), (1,2), (2,3), ...)`

</v-clicks>

---
layout: center
---

#### chain

<hr> 

<v-clicks>

- Chains together multiple iterables
- From this `list(chain('Hello', 'World'))` ...
    - We get this `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']`
- Advantage: it's lazy and doesn't create a new object, like:
    - `combined_list = [*my_list, *my_other_list]`

## Saving the deduplicated data

<hr> 

Basically just an excuse to show grouping of contextmanagers

```python
OUTPUT_FILE = 'library_clean.csv'

def remove_duplicates(iterable: Iterable) -> Iterator: ...


def clean_data(input_csv_file: str) -> str:
    out_name = input_csv_file.replace(".csv", "-clean.csv")

    with (
        Path(input_csv_file).open("r") as read_file,
        Path(out_name).open("w") as write_file,
    ):
        reader = csv.DictReader(read_file)
        writer = csv.DictWriter(write_file)

        for row in remove_duplicates(reader):
            writer.writerow(row)

### Summary

<hr> 

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Generators `yield` values
- Generators always also return a value inside `StopIteration` (default `None`)
- Is it a good idea?
    - No. Most likely not, as it is kind of suprising behaviour
- But why did we just see it?
    - Because sometimes in one-off scripts this is faster and easier than
      a sophisticated object containing the data solution
- What about the middle argument in `Generation[A, B, C]`?
    - Out of scope, but basically we can SEND stuff to generators after their creation
    - `gen = create_generator(); gen.send(123)`
    - Fetch with `received = yield anothervalue; received == 123`

### ü§ì But how would I do it?

<hr>

<v-clicks>

- We use an object to track the data.
    - `NamedTuple` to avoid ugly `result[0]` and `result[1]`
    - Better: `result.lost` and `result.current`
- relatively cheap: We only transport references
- just yield this container instead of complex surprising methods

</v-clicks>

::right::

```python {all|1-4|5-6|16|all}{at:1}
from typing import NamedTuple


class BookMeta(NamedTuple):
    current: BookResponse
    lost: list[BookResponse]


def hide_lost_books(
    iterable: Iterable[BookResponse]
) -> Iterator[BookMeta]:
    lost_books = []

    for book in iterable:
        if extract_year(book["lent_since"]) >= -300:
            yield BookMeta(book, lost_books)
        else:
            lost_books.append(book)
```
